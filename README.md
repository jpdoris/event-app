# Event App
[This is a work in progress]  
Event-App is a single page application exercise built on Laravel and Vue.js. The idea is to create an app to manage events 
(location/venue, dates, sessions, speakers, etc), and display the information, in an SPA.

Management is done in an admin UI that requires authentication and provides an easy, user-friendly
interface.

Front end will be clean, attractive, searchable, and fast.
